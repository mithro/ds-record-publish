This is a set of tools which makes managing publishing of DS records easier.

You need to create a config.ini file in this directory in the following format:
	[dlv]
	username=<username>
	password=<password>

	[gkg]
	username=<username>
	password=<password>

	[domaina.me]
	publish=dlv

	[domaina.com]
	publish=dlv,gkg

You can then run the tools, they are:

	check_root.py -	Check your DS records are published in the root
			servers.
	check_dlv.py -	Check your DS records are published in the DLV look
			aside registary.

	update_gkg.py - Update your DS records on GKG.net
	update_dlv.py - Update your DS records in the DLV look aside registary.
